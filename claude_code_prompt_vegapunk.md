[PHASE 1.3 - SHAKA AUTONOMOUS AGENT]

üß† ULTRATHINK CONTEXT:
Shaka is the ethics and analysis specialist. This agent must demonstrate full autonomy: perceiving the environment, making ethical assessments, planning responses, and learning from outcomes. This implementation will serve as the template for all other agents.

1. Agent lifecycle management
2. Inter-agent communication protocols
3. Shared memory and state management

AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIOR VALIDATION:
- Goal achievement tracking
- Decision quality metrics
- Learning progress indicators
- Collaboration effectiveness measures
- Ethical compliance verification

PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS:
- Agent startup time (<2 seconds)
- Decision latency (<100ms for simple, <1s for complex)
- Memory usage per agent (<50MB baseline)
- Message throughput (>1000 messages/second)
- Error recovery time (<5 seconds)

MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY:
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics collection for all operations
- Health checks for system components
- Performance dashboards
